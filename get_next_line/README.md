The idea of the project is to create a function which will read the information from file descriptors or the standart input and return the next line. This project was kind of tricky because of the memory leaks, I enjoyed doing it though! For this project you need to learn some new stuff, you need to know how file descriptor work, how to use open and read functions from <unistd.h>, and the concept of static variables.
