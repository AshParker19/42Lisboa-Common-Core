The first project of the Common Core. Here you will need to create your own library with the funcions which you you can use during the rest of the course, some funcions you have already done during the piscine, some of them are completely new! Besides writing the functions you need to learn 2 new crussial consepts: headers(.h files) and Makefile, you need to understand them completely, because you will have to use them on a regular basic in your coding life!
